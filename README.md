## Art
A tiny artsy project, it generates images similar to this

## DOTS
Tests working with the new Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS) and the Entity Component System (ECS)

This is a gif representing the capability of DOTS handling lots of physics objects.
10 balls are spawned every frame, which is 600 in a second.

## IK
I wanted to learn what Inverse Kinematics (IK) means, so I wrote my own based on the Forwards And Backwards Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) model.
I also added pole targeting to the model.

The cube is the target, and the cylinder is the pole target.

## NN
My attempt at creating a neural network from scratch. I tried to solve the problem of recognizing hand-drawn numbers.
It was a big failure!

## WFCA
Waveform Collapse Algorithm.
I was fascinated by this algorithm and I tried to create my own copy of it. It doesn't quite work.

Here are two samples and the solutions my code generates.
