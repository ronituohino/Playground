# Playground
This repository is a single Unity project containing multiple small projects and tests.



## ART
A tiny artsy project, it generates images similar to this

## DOTS
Tests working with Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS) and the Entity Component System (ECS) that were at the time recently added to Unity.

This represents the capability of DOTS handling lots of physics objects.
10 balls are spawned every frame, which is 600 in a second.

## IK
I wanted to learn what Inverse Kinematics (IK) means, so I wrote my own based on the Forwards And Backwards Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) model.
I also added pole targeting to the model.

The cube is the target, and the cylinder is the pole target.

## NN
My attempt at creating a neural network from scratch. I tried to solve the problem of recognizing hand-drawn numbers.

It was a big failure!

## WFCA
Waveform Collapse Algorithm.
I was fascinated by this algorithm and I tried to create my own copy of it. It doesn't quiiite work, but it does yield some interesting results nonetheless.

Here are two samples and the solutions my code generates.
